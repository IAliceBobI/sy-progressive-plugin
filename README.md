# Progressive Reading Based on `Digesting` (Digesting Mode)
<details>
  
  > [I guess the image below is probably broken 😢, check here!](https://gitee.com/TokenzQdBN/sy-progressive-plugin/blob/main/README_zh_CN.md)
  
  ## Usage
  
  <img src="assets/digest1.gif" alt="drawing" width="800"/>
  
  **Default shortcut: `Alt+Z`.** This is a menu with multiple functions.
  
  It can also be used in read-only mode with the shortcut `Alt+Z`.
  
  You can digest any document, typically used for progressive reading of imported books.
  
  To minimize disruption during reading, you can first digest the content you find valuable, which will appear later during flashcard review.
  
  Select multiple lines and use `Alt+Z -> 🍕 Digest` or `Alt+Z -> ✂ Digest and Break Sentences by Punctuation`.
  
  You can further digest the digested content, allowing infinite nesting.
  
  The digested documents have the same function and style as the `fragments` in the `fragment mode`.
  
  > **Pressing the shortcut `Alt+Z` twice consecutively triggers digesting.**
  
  ## Lightweight
  
  Compared to the `fragment mode`, there is no automatic fragmentation process. By selecting multiple content blocks in a document, you can perform digesting.
  
  It's akin to manual `fragmentation`. Selecting content blocks can create `fragments`.
  
  > **Note:** You can use digesting on `fragments` generated by the `fragment mode`.
  
  > **Note:** `Digesting mode` can be used simultaneously with `fragment mode`.
  
  ## Flattened
  
  Multi-level digesting does not create multi-level folders. All digests are in the same folder.
  
  ## Word & Flashcard
  
  <img src="assets/createWords.gif" alt="drawing" width="800"/>
  
  ## Card Creation
  
  <img src="assets/createCard1.gif" alt="drawing" width="800"/>
  
  It can also be used in read-only mode with the shortcut.
  
  Digesting can be seen as a draft, where you can jot down notes and then create cards.
  
  Card creation can use the following: ``` Writing-style Flashcards Alt+` ```, `Card Creation Alt+E`, ``` Daily Card Alt+S and Alt+` ```
  
  ## Review
  
  It is recommended to use the `flashcard button` in the `toolbar` of the `Tomato Toolbox`. This `tab` method of reviewing flashcards allows for convenient digesting.
  
  ## Flashcard Transfer Strategy (Multiple)
  
  Each digest is turned into a flashcard.
  
  > `Alt+Z -> 🗃️` can switch to the `single` mode.
  > Each book has its own `flashcard transfer strategy`.
  
  ## Flashcard Transfer Strategy (Single)
  
  > `Alt+Z -> 🗃️` can switch to the `multiple` mode.
  
  Each time a digest is made, the flashcard for that digest is maintained.
  
  Among all digests of a book (a document), only one digest has a flashcard.
  
  This strategy determines which digest gets the flashcard, so it appears in flashcard review.
  
  When creating a digest, the flashcard always transfers to the newly created flashcard.
  
  After clicking `Alt+Z -> 🔨` on the flashcard, the digest is marked as `completed`, and the flashcard will transfer to another `incomplete` digest.
  
  Considering that you may manually select any digest for study in the document tree, the following strategy is defined for easy backtracking after free exploration:
  
  The flashcard of the current digest will preferentially transfer to an older digest that is closest in time to itself and open it.
  
  If there is none, the flashcard will transfer to the most recently created digest and open it.
  
  If there are no `incomplete` digests left, it will jump to the original content block corresponding to the digest where `Alt+Z -> 🔨` was just clicked.
  
  > The review count of flashcards does not accumulate; it is cleared with each transfer.
  
  > New flashcards will automatically be marked as difficult once and have their due date reset to the current time (consistent with the `reading point` strategy of the `Tomato Toolbox`), allowing immediate review.
  > This operation is to adjust the next review time corresponding to each difficulty level.
  
  ## Open Previous, Next Digest
  
  `Alt+Z -> 👈` `Alt+Z -> 👉`
  
  Using this function on a digest will open the digest in the original text that is close in proximity.
  
  ## Clean Up Completed Digests
  
  Use within any digest file:
  
  `Alt+Z -> 🗑️` will delete the digest files in the completed state.
  
  ## Digest Trace Chain `Alt+Z -> 🌲`
  
  <img src="assets/ditestTree.gif" alt="drawing" width="800"/>
  
  Use within any digest file:
  
  `Alt+Z -> 🌲` will open the trace file. Each line represents a digest path, with each node on the path being a digest file, ultimately pointing to the original text.

# Shard-Based Incremental Reading (Shard Mode)
<details>
  
  Divide long documents into smaller segments, referred to here as `shards`, and read each `shard` one by one. During the reading process, you can take notes and create flashcards.
  
  This method opens up the possibility of reading multiple books and materials simultaneously.

    * [Incremental Reading Process in SiYuan Notes with Incremental Learning Plugin - ChainDrop](https://ld246.com/article/1704599752251)
  
  **Note:** *Flashcards are the core; this plugin merely helps us read books more comfortably and consistently, thereby extracting high-quality flashcards from them.*

  ## Adding Documents
  
  The first step to start using this is to open a book.
  
  If you don't have a book, you can import one using other plugins.
  
  **Open a longer document for incremental learning. First, open the plugin menu and click `Add Current Document`.**
  
  <img src="assets/addDoc.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/>
  
  The plugin will prompt you to split the document. As shown in the figure:
  
  <img src="assets/split.png" alt="drawing" width="300"/>
  
  Here, you are provided with three splitting methods: `Headings`, `Block Count`, and `Word Count`. These methods can be used together or individually.
  
  When combined, the splitting methods follow a sequence: `As shown in the figure, from top to bottom, split first by headings, then each section by block count, and finally each block by word count.`
  
  It sounds a bit complex, but in actual use, it's not that complicated.
  
  I've summarized three common methods below; choose one for a book.
  
  > [If images do not load, please check here](https://gitee.com/TokenzQdBN/sy-progressive-plugin/blob/main/README_zh_CN.md)
  
  **1. Split by Headings**
  
  Books are usually composed of various levels of headings. Splitting by headings will divide the book into multiple shards based on the input headings. Default splits include h1~h6. If you don't want to split h5 and h6, you can input: "1,2,3,4".
  
  For example, when splitting a web novel, which typically has only major headings, each heading represents a chapter, so each shard is a chapter of the novel.
  
  If the book is more complex, with sections and subsections, each shard will be a subsection.
  
  If a subsection is still too large to fully grasp in one reading, you can read it roughly first, then add new appropriate level headings based on your understanding. Then, for this shard, you can perform another round of `split by headings`.
  
  *The plugin supports further splitting of shards.*
  
  **2. Split by Headings + Word Count**
  
  If you want to control the word count of each shard, use this method. However, note that if the book has many words, the splitting process will take a long time...
  
  For larger documents, such as a three-million-word document, splitting by word count can be time-consuming.
  
  Therefore, you can use a combination of headings and block count.
  
  **3. Split by Headings + Block Count**
  
  To control the word count of shards and quickly split the book, use the headings + block count method.
  
  This method roughly controls the word count of each shard, but it's not precise. Hmm... it seems a bit imprecise...
  
  > The `shard` operation of the plugin does not modify the original text or create new documents; it only reads, counts, and saves.
  
  > `Automatic Card Creation` means that each `shard` is turned into a flashcard when read.
  
  > **Note** Some book content may require repeated consideration to extract high-quality flashcards, and `automatic card creation` only creates rough cards.
  
  > **Caution** After `sharding`, do not modify the original book, such as deleting blocks, as this will cause the plugin to fail to find these blocks during learning.
  
  ## Starting to Learn
  
  After successfully adding a book, we proceed to the reading phase.
  
  **Opening the plugin menu and clicking `Start Learning` will open the first segment of the book.**
  
  > The shortcut for `Start Learning` is `Alt+-`, which is right after `Flashcards` `Alt+0`. One is for learning, the other for review.
  > Open a random segment: `Alt+Shift+-`
  
  <img src="assets/reading.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/>
  
  > [If you can't open the image, click here](https://gitee.com/TokenzQdBN/sy-progressive-plugin/blob/main/README_zh_CN.md)
  
  **The `Segment` title has a `Segment Number` prefix.**
  
  **At the end of each paragraph in the `Segment`, there is a `*` linking to the original document.**
  
  **The content in the `Segment` can be freely modified, paragraphs can be added, cards can be made, etc. Original text can be inserted at any time.**
  
  > **Tip** After modifying the content, the update of the `Index` will be slightly delayed, and the plugin relies on the `Index`. If you click a button immediately after modifying the text, it may not take effect.
  
  * `🗂`: Open the book's table of contents, which can be used to locate the desired segment.
  * `⬅`: Go to the previous `Segment`.
  * `➡`: Go to the next `Segment`.
  * `⬇`: Insert the content of the corresponding `Segment` from the original text.
  * `🧹🧹`: Delete the original text.
  * `⬅ 🗑`: Delete the current segment and go to the previous `Segment`.
  * `🗑 ➡`: Delete the current segment and go to the next `Segment`.
  * `🗑 🏃`: Delete the current segment.
  * `＋🗃`: Turn the current document into flashcards.
  * `－🗃`: Delete the flashcards of the current document itself, without affecting the flashcards within the document.
  * `🏃`: Close the segment.
  * `📚📖`: Switch to another book.
  * `🚫`: Stop pushing this book, and it can be reopened in `View All Progressive Learning Documents`.
  * `⚡`: Review the flashcards of the current book.
  * `✂📜`: Split the original text within the segment according to punctuation, creating a layout with one sentence per line for easier reading.
  * `✂📜✅`: Break sentences according to punctuation, forming a task list (tasks can be checked off with ctrl+enter).
  * `✂📜📌`: Same as above, but the split content is displayed as an unordered list.
  
  > **Tip** When a `Segment` is deleted, its document flashcards are also deleted.
  
  > **Tip** Deleted `Segments` will be recreated if they are read again.
  
  > **Tip** The document title of each `Segment` can be modified. However, do not modify the document notes, otherwise, the plugin will not be able to find the document later.
  
  ## Reading the Paragraph Under the Cursor
  
  If you want to start reading from a specific part of the original document, you can use the `Read the Paragraph Under the Cursor` feature.
  
  Open an original document that has been added to progressive learning, navigate to a specific location, right-click the menu: `Plugin` -> `Read the Paragraph Under the Cursor`, and you will jump to this `Segment`.
  
  <img src="assets/rightClickMenu.png" alt="drawing" width="300"/>
</details>

## Making Flashcards
<details>
  
  ### Making Cloze Cards `Alt+E`
  
  Select the content to be `cloze deleted`, such as in the image:
  
  <img src="assets/selected.png" alt="drawing" width="700"/>
  
  The flashcard will be created in a new file on the right and the file will be opened.
  
  Flashcards are created in list form, making it easy to write down your thoughts below.
  
  <img src="assets/card.png" alt="drawing" width="900"/>
  
  Some flashcards can be tagged with multiple references, separated by spaces, as shown in the following image:
  
  <img src="assets/refLeading.png" alt="drawing" width="700"/>
  
  This allows you to view all related content in the backlink panel.
  
  We continue to think and progressively write through the flashcard mechanism.
  
  <img src="assets/bk.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>
  
  > Recommended to be used with the `Pomodoro Toolbox` feature `Flashcard Priority` and `Bottom Backlinks`.
  
  > [If you can't open the image, click here](https://gitee.com/TokenzQdBN/sy-progressive-plugin/blob/main/README_zh_CN.md)
  
  ### Making Cards Directly, Without Cloze Deletion, Still `Alt+E`
  
  Place the cursor in the content without selection, and make flashcards using the menu or shortcut key.
  
  ### Multi-line Selection, or `Alt+E`
  
  The following image shows two lines selected:
  
  <img src="assets/multilines.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>
  
  > Use the shortcut key: `Alt+E`
  
  This will generate and insert a flashcard below, as shown in the image:
  
  <img src="assets/multilinesCard.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>
  
  > **Note** If card creation is done within a segment, the cards will be placed in a subfolder of the book. For example, if the book is named ABC, all cards will be collected in the ABC-cards file.
  
  ### Daily Card `Alt+S` or `Ctrl+`
  
  Right-click menu or shortcut keys `Ctrl+` to quote the original text or `Alt+S` to not quote the original text to create cards, which will be archived in the Daily Card folder. The result is similar to Daily Note.
  
  <img src="assets/dailyCardMenu.png" alt="drawing" width="300"/>
  
  This will create the following directory structure and make cards:
  
  ![Alt text](assets/dailyCardTree.png)
  
  ### Writing-style Flashcards `Alt+`
  
  <img src="assets/writingCardInit.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/>
  
  After creation, the original text will also insert an embedded block of the flashcard, and the content created in the flashcard will also reflect in the original text.
  
  <img src="assets/writingCard.png" alt="drawing" width="1000"/>
  
  ### Multi-line Cloze `Alt+D`
  
  <img src="assets/multilineblank.gif" alt="drawing" width="800"/>
  
  The official `Alt+D` can be deleted, and the plugin's `Alt+D` will automatically take effect.
  
  This implements the official cloze deletion function and adds a multi-line cloze deletion feature.
  
  Select multiple lines, and use `Alt+D`.
  
  When reviewing flashcards, the content that has been blanked out is treated as the answer and is hidden.
</details>

## Command Palette Tool
<details>
  
  Replace `*` and `@` with hyperlinks `siyuan://`. Shortcut key `F9`.
</details>

## Move Blocks within Segments to Previous or Next Segment
<details>
  
  ![Alt text](assets/moveBlock.png)
</details>

## Collection Function `alt+shift+z`
<details>
  
  This function can copy selected content from various segments to the `summary-*` file.
  
  It is convenient for analyzing and summarizing content that is far apart within segments.
  
  It is particularly helpful for books that require comparison between distant segments.
  
  If not used within segments, it will collect to the daily note.
</details>

## Imitation Practice Process
<details>
  
  The imitation practice process, also known as the translation practice process.
  
  ### Step 1
  
  Within segments, summarize or list the key points of the original content block in the simplest language, or translate the original text.
  
  Then right-click `Extract Notes`.
  
  As expected, a file starting with `keys-` will be generated below the segment.
  
  <img src="assets/practiceExtract.png" alt="drawing" width="1000"/>
  
  > [If the image cannot be opened, please check here](https://gitee.com/TokenzQdBN/sy-progressive-plugin/blob/main/README_zh_CN.md)
  
  ### Step 2
  
  In the `keys-` file, rewrite the original text in your own words based on your previous summary or translation.
  
  <img src="assets/rewrite.png" alt="drawing" width="1000"/>
  
  Finally, in the `keys-` file, right-click `Compare with Original`.
  
  As expected, a file starting with `compare-` will be generated below the segment.
  
  <img src="assets/compare.png" alt="drawing" width="1000"/>
</details>

## Extract Notes from All Shards
Use ctrl+f4, right-click on the shard to use.

## Merge All Shards into a New File
Right-click on the shard to use. For shards that have been modified, using this function is equivalent to creating a new book of your own.
